          <h1>Bio</h1>
          <p>Hi, My name's Isabel Harris! I was born in Chicago, Illinois, where I still live today. I am currently a freshman attending Lane Tech, a top-rated selective enrollment high school. This website was created as a project for Honors Web Development, the computer science class I'm currently taking. This is actually my final, so I hope I get a good grade! A bit more about my history with computer science: My first time coding was in my kindergarten typing class. Every year, our school did a program called Hour Of Code, where they let students solve puzzles with drag-and-drop code blocks. A while later, I was introduced to scratch, a similar website with a social media element (which was eventually why I left, long story, don't ask) I didn't come back to computer science until I had a class on the subject in eighth grade. Although it was a really bad computer science class, I still wanted to pursue it for high school. When the school offered me the oppurtunity to take Honors Web Development, I took it because I wanted a more challenging course. I've never regretted not taking that opportunity, since it's been a lot of fun and I'm learning more than I would have in the introductory course anyway. Here's some fun facts about me:</p>
          <ul class="list-group pb-3">
            <li class="list-group-item">My favorite colors are green, black, and purple.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">I'm an only child</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">I've ridden in a bus for over fourteen hours straight</li>
